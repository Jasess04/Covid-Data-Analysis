 Covid-Data-Analysis
 
This project is focused on daily reported data published by John Hopkins University for February 2nd, 2022. The data was pulled from the Covid-19 Data Repository by the Center for Science and Engineering (CSSE) at John Hopkins University. The data is published as a CVS file every day. The project will be taking the raw CVS data and turning it into a bar graph that shows the top 20 countries with the most confirmed covid cases from most to least descending.
