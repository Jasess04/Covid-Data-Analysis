# Covid-Data-Analysis
This project is focused on daily reported data published by John Hopkins University for February 2nd, 2022. The data was pulled from the Covid-19 Data Repository by the Center for Science and Engineering (CSSE) at John Hopkins University. The data is published as a CVS file every day. The project will be taking the raw CVS data and turning it into a bar graph that shows the top 20 countries with the most confirmed covid cases from most to least descending. 

These are the packages that will need to be imported in order to make the program run. 

import pandas as pd #                 pandas is being used to manipulate matplotlib and NumPy

import numpy as np #                  numby is being used for mathematical operations

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #     matplot is used for data visualization

import seaborn as sns #               the data visualization library used in conjuction with matplotlib



Category 2: Utilize External Data:
Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application.

Category 3: Data Display
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.

“STRETCH” FEATURE LIST:
Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display.
